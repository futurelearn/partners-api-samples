# FutureLearn Partners API samples

This repo contains two sample applications for the FutureLearn partners API.

[FutureLearn-initiated enrolment sample app](https://github.com/Futurelearn/partners-api-samples/tree/master/fl_initiated_enrolment)

This basic Ruby on Rails application is designed to emulate the
university-hosted degree or program enrolment form in the
FutureLearn-initiated enrolment flow.

[Student recruitment sample app](https://github.com/Futurelearn/partners-api-samples/tree/master/student_recruitment)

This basic Ruby on Rails application is designed to demonstrate how
student recruitment webhook and API can be used to transfer student
recruitment leads from FutureLearn to a partner.

Detailed documentation of these flows and the API credentials required to
run the applications are available from your Partnership Manager or
technical contact at FutureLearn.

Further details can be found in the README for each app.
